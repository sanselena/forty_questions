This is a repository that started with forty-ish question long python crash course, which included problems similar to LeetCode. 
Now, it's a simple zip that houses simple problem solving algorithms, all solved in python. Perfect study material for an algorithms course.
  * Some problems include pseudo-code in comments, as well as personal notes.
  * Some files are .ipynb while some of them are .py, this is because i had to submit some in different formats. You can easily convert them, since the code is very simple.
